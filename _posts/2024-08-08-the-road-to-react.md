I recently read [The Road to React](https://www.roadtoreact.com/){:target="_blank"} by Robin Wieruch, and in this post I'd like to recommend it as probably the best React book for novices.

Experienced programmers often argue that technologies should be studied through documentation, noting that the process of editing and publishing books takes time, during which technologies can change significantly. However, this book is an exception, as it is self-published.

> Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is selfpublished, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released.

While I agree that studying documentation is beneficial, especially for experienced programmers, beginners may struggle to understand the purpose of a library when encountering it for the first time. Therefore, a book can be an excellent starting point.

Now, let's consider the pros of the book. First and foremost, Robin Wieruch is an exceptional teacher who explains complex concepts in simple language â€” a rare skill among programmers. The book includes detailed illustrations, code samples, and numerous footnotes to Robin's articles that provide in-depth coverage of React.

Some reviews on Goodreads mention insufficient coverage of certain topics, but I believe this stems from readers not exploring the footnotes, which contain valuable information.

There is one small drawback. The first half of the book is detailed and rich in explanations of basic concepts, while the second half, which covers styles, React + TypeScript, and testing, may not be as practical for beginners. For example, someone unfamiliar with TypeScript may not gain much from rewriting a project in it. It might be more effective to provide a roadmap in the conclusion and omit these sections.

That said, the "Real World React" section is excellent and shows how to use React to solve real world problems. It would be more logical to place this section right after the first part and end the book there.

In summary, Robin Wieruch guides you through the journey of developing a real project, helping you understand the React philosophy and learn the basics at a solid level. This book gives beginners who have never worked with frontend libraries or frameworks a valuable head start.
