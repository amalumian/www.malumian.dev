description: This post is an introduction by Arthur Malumian to his new personal website and blog. It's his very first blog post.

Hello Internet, this is the first post on my new website. Honestly, this is my first post in my whole life. I think it is necessary to introduce myself first. In short, my name is Arthur Malumian, and I am a programmer. On this [page](/about/) you can find more information about me.
Lately I have been thinking that it would be a good idea to do some writing, but the question is: where?

## Where

I thought: Maybe I should choose Twitter (X) or LinkedIn or Facebook. All these social media sites are really cool, but my feeling is that you have to have a certain theme on them. For example, take Twitter - shitposting about nothing, LinkedIn - everything clearly relevant to work, Facebook - I don't think it's worth explaining. I didn't want to put myself in a box and I thought it would be a good idea to create my own website, I am a programmer after all. But the question is: what to write about?

## What

Since I don't want to limit myself to one topic, my plan is to write about everything that is of interest to me at some point in my life (programming articles, book and movie reviews, travel stories, and just plain old thoughts on life). I don't plan to post regularly, I will only post when I have something to say. I'll note that I don't claim to have great thoughts, this is just my blog. But the question is: why?

## Why

The answer to the question will not be verbose. The main reason I decided to start blogging is simply that since we live in the age of technology and there is an opportunity to record my thoughts on the World Wide Web, it would be foolish to deny myself. Besides, don't you find it interesting to go back to your texts after a while and look at your past self?

Special thanks to the Jekyll team for the great tool that helped me create this blog.

```js
console.log('Hello, Internet!');
