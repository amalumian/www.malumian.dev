  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I'd like to call programming my hobby, but I get paid for it :)</p>
  <p>
    Fiction and art films are a big part of my life. I can't imagine myself
    without them. I also love video games, but I don't have as much time to play
    now as I did when I was a teenager. I like to organize everything that can
    be organized, so you can check out my profiles on
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/amalumian" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>,
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107408671/" target="_blank">IMDb</a>,
    and

    Additionally, you may enjoy listening to my public playlists on
